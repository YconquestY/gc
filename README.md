Welcome to the L₃ project, composed of an L₃ compiler, a virtual machine, a library and a few example programs. The directories are laid out as follows:

- `compiler` contains the source code of the L₃ compiler,
- `vm/c` contains the source code of the C version of the L₃ virtual machine,
- `library` contains the source code of the L₃ library,
- `examples` contains a few example L₃ programs and benchmarks.

Most of these directories contain a `README.md` file with further information.
